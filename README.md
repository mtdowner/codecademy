# BUILD A WEBSITE WITH HTML, CSS, AND GITHUB PAGES

__Objective__

## Off-Platform Project: Excursion

In this project, you'll create a web page which advertises a product called "Excursion." You'll use your growing toolset including HTML, CSS, Command Line Interface, Git, and GitHub. You'll be proud of yourself when it all comes together!

The web page we'll build advertises a mobile app which helps users record and share their experiences, so we'll use video and landscape imagery to set the scene. A landing page is a vital tool in marketing a product these days, and the goal will be to entice potential customers into using the product.

We'll work with Git and GitHub on our local machines, so if you haven't yet, refer to the articles on Command Line Interface Setup and Git Setup.

A preview of the page is available [here](https://content.codecademy.com/programs/freelance-one/excursion/index.html?_gl=1*9ghbp4*_ga*MDY2MzcwNTU2OS4xNjc1OTkyODMw*_ga_3LRZM6TM9L*MTY4NjYwOTA0NS4xOS4wLjE2ODY2MDkwNDUuNjAuMC4w)!

__Tasks__

1.  [x] Download the [design mock](https://content.codecademy.com/programs/freelance-one/excursion/mocks/excursion.png?_gl=1*1ewwq58*_ga*MDY2MzcwNTU2OS4xNjc1OTkyODMw*_ga_3LRZM6TM9L*MTY4NjYwOTA0NS4xOS4wLjE2ODY2MDkwNDUuNjAuMC4w) and [redline mock](https://content.codecademy.com/programs/freelance-one/excursion/mocks/excursion_redline.png?_gl=1*1ewwq58*_ga*MDY2MzcwNTU2OS4xNjc1OTkyODMw*_ga_3LRZM6TM9L*MTY4NjYwOTA0NS4xOS4wLjE2ODY2MDkwNDUuNjAuMC4w). Review these, and think about how you might implement the web page with HTML and CSS.

2. [x] Open your command line interface. Make sure your current working directory matches your expectations. Make a new directory called __excursion__.

3. [x] Make a new file named __index.html__. Make a new directory named __resources__. Inside __resources__, make another directory called __css__. Inside __css__, create a single file for your page’s custom CSS, __style.css__.

4. [x] Make sure your current working directory is __excursion__ and then initialize a Git repository.

5. [x] Add the HTML and CSS files to Git’s staging area. Make your first commit with a simple message.

6. [x] Let’s set up a remote GitHub repository. Go to GitHub’s homepage to make a new repository. Call it `excursion`. Follow the instructions to add an existing Git repository, since you have already initialized yours on your own computer.

After you pushed to your remote repository, refresh your repository page on GitHub. You should see your new files!

7. [x] Open __index.html__ and add the necessary boilerplate code, including the link to your CSS file. Then make the top-most header and link as seen on the design mock.

8. [x] Add the updated __index.html__ file to Git’s staging area and commit again. An appropriate message might be "Add boilerplate HTML and begin page content".

9. [x] Continue replicating the mock by adding the video component, supporting text, and images. Here are the resources you’ll need:

- [MP4 stock video](https://content.codecademy.com/programs/freelance-one/excursion/videos/excursion.mp4?_gl=1*qu8q62*_ga*MDY2MzcwNTU2OS4xNjc1OTkyODMw*_ga_3LRZM6TM9L*MTY4NjYxMTU2MC4yMC4wLjE2ODY2MTE1NjAuNjAuMC4w)
- [Landscape image](https://content.codecademy.com/programs/freelance-one/excursion/images/camp.jpg?_gl=1*qu8q62*_ga*MDY2MzcwNTU2OS4xNjc1OTkyODMw*_ga_3LRZM6TM9L*MTY4NjYxMTU2MC4yMC4wLjE2ODY2MTE1NjAuNjAuMC4w)
- [Cellphone icon](https://content.codecademy.com/programs/freelance-one/excursion/images/phone.png?_gl=1*qu8q62*_ga*MDY2MzcwNTU2OS4xNjc1OTkyODMw*_ga_3LRZM6TM9L*MTY4NjYxMTU2MC4yMC4wLjE2ODY2MTE1NjAuNjAuMC4w)

We’re leaving you to complete this web page on your own, we trust you can do it. Here are some notes to help make it the best you can:

The white "Cellphone icon" image linked above will appear blank against the white background. We promise it's there!

Make new directories inside the resources directory called __images__ and __videos__ to store these items.

Since your images, videos, and stylesheets are all in the __resources__ directory, you'll need to include that in the path when you link to them. For example, the path to your stylesheet will be `resources/css/style.css`.

By default, images will appear on the same line as the element before them. In the mock, all our images are centered on their own line. To effect this, make a new paragraph element and put the image element inside of it.

10. [x] When you have added a feature, or made any other concise change to the HTML or CSS, commit again. Add a commit message which describes the changes you’ve made. Continue to commit at opportune moments.

11. [x] Push your local changes to your repository on GitHub. Reload your GitHub repository page in your browser to see that your new commits saved to the cloud. If you completed all of the GitHub Pages setup steps, this project should be automatically deployed. Navigate to http://<user.github./<repository-name> to view the deployed version of your project.

12. - [x] To complete the page, add the footer and any remaining CSS. Review the redline mock and confirm your progress.

-[ ] 13. When you are satisfied with your work, make sure to commit your changes once again. Your commit message should reflect that you feel this is complete! Finally, push your changes to GitHub.

Now take a step back, reflect, and be proud; you’ve accomplished a lot!
