# Python Terminal Game

Welcome to the portfolio project in CS 101: Introduction to Programming!

In this portfolio project, you will research, brainstorm, and build a basic terminal program of your choice for your friends and family to play with. After you finish building the program, you will create a blog post to share the program on a publication of your choice!

## Project Ideas:
- Blackjack
- Tic-Tac-Toe
- Connect Four
- Battleship
- Minesweeper
- Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?
- Tarot Reading
- NYC MetroCard Price Calculator
- Mortgage Calculator
- Today‚Äôs Horoscope
- Your Very Own Text-Based Adventure

## Project Objectives:
- Build a terminal program using Python
- Add at least one interactive feature using `input()`
- Use Git version control
- Use the command line and file navigation
- Write a technical blog post on the project

## Prerequisites:
- Python
- Git/GitHub
- Command Line and File Navigation

## To Do

### Think of an Idea
Take some time to think of an idea for your project. üí°

Some questions you can ask yourself is:

Who do you want to build something for? Yourself? Your friends? Your family? Your co-workers?

What are your/their hobbies?

Do you want to build something more fun or something more useful?

If you are having trouble thinking of one, take a look at the example projects!

### Project Brainstorming
Now that you have an idea, visualize the end result:

- What does your program do?to
- How will it work in a terminal?
- Is it one player or two players?

Make sure that it satisfies all of the project objectives.

Make a timeline for yourself and avoid the temptation to build things that aren‚Äôt required. Setting firm boundaries and deadlines will keep you on track and prevent scope creep.

The following tasks will help you identify natural breakpoints.

Properly scoping your project will greatly benefit you; scoping creates structure while requiring you to think through your entire project before you begin. You should start with stating the goals for your project, then gathering the data, and considering the analytical steps required. A proper project scope can be a great road map for your project, but keep in mind that some down-stream tasks may become dead ends which will require adjustment to the scope.

Two-player mini-game programs are usually a little bit harder to build, but definitely doable!

### Write Your Program
This is the bulk portion of your project.

Start with creating the variables that you need and then text prompts that will let the user understand what the program is.

Constantly run the program every few lines to make sure you knock out the bugs as you go.

### Refactoring
Now that you have a working program, try to go back to it see what you can do better?

- Can you add some functions to make the code more byte-sized?
- Can you add a class & object somewhere?

### Blog Post
Once you‚Äôve completed the program, you‚Äôre ready to create your blog post.

Create a blog post using Medium, Dev.to, or some other blogging platform.

Your blog post should include the following:

- A compelling title about your program
- An introduction sharing the background info (the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù)
- An image or a GIF of your program
- An accompanying paragraph describing your Python code
- A link to your code on GitHub.
- A conclusion

### Setting up your GitHub Repository
Create a new GitHub repository for this project and add a Python file inside.

Don‚Äôt forget to name your file!

Your Python program should have a name, something like `name.py`.

If you need more guidance, review the:

- GitHub Desktop article
- Git Cheatsheet

### Version Control
Set up Git tracking in your directory and make sure to add and commit changes as you make them.

Set up Git tracking with
```bash
git init PROJECTNAME
```
Stage changes with:
```bash
git add FILENAME
```
Commit changes with:
```bash
git commit -m "MESSAGE"
```
