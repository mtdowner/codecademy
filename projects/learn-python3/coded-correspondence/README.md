# Off-Platform Project: Coded Correspondence
In this off-platform project, you will be exchanging coded communications with your pen pal, Vishal. The two of you challenge each other by sending coded messages that you will have to use your Python skills to decipher! Put your programming skills to the test with these fun cryptography puzzles.

Follow the steps below to get started with your project!

## Working on Your Computer

1. If youâ€™ve never used the command line, we recommend taking the Learn the Command Line course.
2. Install Python by following the directions in this article on Installing Python.
3. Learn about Jupyter Notebooks, a cool way of combining Python code with explanations or instruction in a web terminal.
4. Download the project: Coded Correspondence
5. Unzip it by double-clicking on it.
6. In the terminal, navigate to the directory containing the project, and type:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

This should open a browser tab.

7. Click on `coded_correspondence.ipynb` in the browser tab. This will open up your Jupyter Notebook.
8. Follow the steps in the Jupyter Notebook. If you get stuck, you can look at `coded_correspondence_solutions.ipynb` for the answer.

This is a challenging project! Be prepared to come up with your own creative methods of solving the problems!
