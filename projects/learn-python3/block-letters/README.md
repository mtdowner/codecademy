# Block Letters

ASCII art is a graphic design technique that uses computers for presentation and consists of pictures pieced together from individual characters.

Write a Python program called `initials.py` that displays the initials of your name in block letters as shown and dip your toes into ASCII art.

![ASCII art of letters. For example, the ASCII art of the letter F is comprised of 5 characters in the first row, one character in the second and third rows, three characters in the fourth row, and one character in the fifth, sixth, and seventh row. These characters when viewed together look like the letter F](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-cpp/hello-world/block-letters.png)

Happy coding!

## Tasks

Check off all the tasks as you go. Once all are completed you can complete the project.

### Task 1
What we are building in this project:

Take a look at the [complete alphabet](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-cpp/hello-world/block-letters-hint.png) and find your initials. Notice how each block letter is 7x5 and formed by the letter itself.

My initials are S and L, so my `initials.py` program should output:

```py
 SSS   L
S   S  L
S      L
 SSS   L
    S  L
S   S  L
 SSS   LLLLL
```

Once you are ready, mark this task complete by checking off the box.

## Setting up:

### Task 2
First, write two comments with:

- Your first and last name.
- A fun fact about yourself.

### Task 3
Output your first initial as a block letter. There are a few ways to do this!

Press **Save** to run your program.

### Task 4
Output your second initial as a block letter by adding to the `print()` statements.

Press **Save** to run your program.

### Task 5
