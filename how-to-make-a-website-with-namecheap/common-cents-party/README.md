# HOW TO MAKE A WEBSITE WITH NAMECHEAP

## Common Cents Party

The band, Common Cents Party, has asked you to work on two webpages for their website. Now that you have been introduced to some fundamental HTML elements, you are ready to help the band. Let’s get started.

1. Start by creating the page structure.

In `index.html`, there are currently three `divs` on the page. The `div` with class container has two children. Set the class of the first child `div` to `nav`. Set the class of the second child `div` to `main`.
2. Inside the `div` with class nav, create an `h4` element which displays “Common Cents Party” to serve as the `navbar` heading.

3. Below the `h4`, create a `ul` element with `li` items for different pages the site offers:

- Home
- Shows
- Albums
- Gallery
- Bio
- Blog

4. Next, inside the `div` with class `main`, create an `h1` heading element that displays “Common Cents Party”.
5. Below the `h1` heading, create an image element that has the following image URL as its `src` attribute:

```
htmlhttps://content.codecademy.com/projects/make-a-website/lesson-1/band.jpg
```

6. Below the image of the band, create a paragraph element to include a recent review:

```
“Common Cents Party, a hard-hitting acoustic punk/electronic four-piece from Atlanta, Georgia, combines an unleashed live performance with edgy lyrics, unforgettable hooks and well-studied synth-rock sounds. A must-see, must-hear new band.” -Screech Magazine
```

7. Next, create an anchor element that links users to a list of the band’s upcoming shows.

The `href` attribute for the anchor element should be set to `shows.html`. The text for the anchor could say “Here’s a list of upcoming shows”.

Test out your anchor element in the web browser.

8. The band has asked you to include video from a recent live performance.

In the file `shows.html`, below the `h1` heading that displays “Upcoming Shows”, create a video element.

Play with the `height` and `width` attributes until the video’s size looks right to you. Then, set the video source to:

```html
https://content.codecademy.com/projects/make-a-website/lesson-1/liveshow.mp4
```

Play the video in the web browser to make sure it works.
